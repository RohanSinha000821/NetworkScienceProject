# NetworkScienceProject

A reproducible network-science workflow for studying the structural evolution of the **US–Israel–Iran conflict system** through event data, actor interaction networks, community structure, and bridge-actor analysis.

This repository combines **ACLED** and **UCDP GED** event data, harmonizes them into a common schema, filters the study to the core regional theater, segments the timeline into analytically meaningful phases, and builds network outputs suitable for quantitative analysis and visualization.

---

## 1. Project overview

The project asks a structural question:

> **How did the present regional conflict configuration emerge?**

Instead of treating the present escalation as an isolated event, the workflow models the conflict system as an evolving network of actors across multiple theaters. The analysis focuses on:

- actor interaction structure,
- temporal expansion of the conflict system,
- community formation and fragmentation,
- bridge actors connecting otherwise distinct communities,
- phase-wise differences between earlier and current escalation patterns.

The study uses a **multi-source event-data pipeline**:

- **ACLED** for broad historical event coverage and actor-pair structure,
- **UCDP GED** releases for extension into the 2025–2026 period.

---

## 2. Research goals

The repository is organized around five analytical goals:

1. **Harmonize** ACLED and GED into a consistent event schema.
2. **Filter** the dataset to the core theater:
   - Israel
   - Palestine
   - Lebanon
   - Syria
   - Iraq
   - Yemen
   - Iran
   - United States
3. **Segment** the event stream into three phases:
   - **Phase 1:** 2015–2018 — Transitional Shadow Phase
   - **Phase 2:** 2019–2021 — Escalatory Hybrid Phase
   - **Phase 3:** 2022–2026 — Current Escalation Phase
4. **Build actor networks** and derive graph metrics.
5. **Interpret structural change** using centrality, modularity, communities, and bridge actors.

## 4. Expected local working structure

When running the full workflow locally, it is useful to maintain a working structure like this:

```text

## 5. Data sources

This project relies on conflict event data from:

- **ACLED** for coded event records and actor interaction fields,
- **UCDP GED** releases for event continuity into 2025–2026.

### Local input files used in the current workflow

The local analysis described in this repository used:

- `ACLED Data_2026-04-10.csv`
- `GEDEvent_v25_01_25_12.csv`
- `GEDEvent_v26_0_1.csv`
- `GEDEvent_v26_0_2.csv`

> Important:
> Raw datasets may be large and may not be committed to Git depending on licensing, file size, or local policy. If the repository does not contain the raw CSVs, place them manually inside `data/`.

---

## 6. Processing pipeline

The full workflow follows these stages.

### Phase 1 — Harmonization
ACLED and GED are mapped into a unified schema with consistent names for:
- event ID,
- event date,
- actor fields,
- geographic fields,
- fatalities,
- notes,
- event-type fields,
- provenance metadata.

Key point:
- the revised ACLED export includes native `actor2`, `assoc_actor_2`, and `inter2`,
  which makes actor–actor analysis methodologically stronger than the earlier proxy-based version.

### Phase 2 — Scope filtering
The harmonized dataset is restricted to the core theater:

- Israel
- Palestine
- Lebanon
- Syria
- Iraq
- Yemen
- Iran
- United States

This creates the **main analysis dataset** used for the reported results.

### Phase 3 — Phase segmentation
Rows are labeled by historical phase:

- **Phase 1:** 2015–2018  
- **Phase 2:** 2019–2021  
- **Phase 3:** 2022–2026  

This enables phase-wise network comparison.

### Phase 4 — Network construction
The pipeline builds:

- **actor–actor edge lists**
- **event–actor bipartite edge lists**
- **phase-wise actor–actor networks**

### Phase 5 — Network metrics
Graph metrics are computed, including:

- degree,
- weighted degree,
- degree centrality,
- betweenness centrality,
- eigenvector centrality,
- clustering coefficient,
- density,
- connected components,
- largest connected component size.

### Phase 6 — Community and bridge-actor analysis
Community structure is detected using **Louvain modularity optimization**, followed by bridge-actor ranking.

### Phase 7 — Report-ready outputs
Phase-wise comparison tables, cleaned bridge-actor tables, and presentation-ready figures are generated.

---

## 7. Main results snapshot

The current strict core-theater analysis produced a phase-segmented dataset of **546,300 events**.

### Actor–actor network growth across phases

| Phase | Nodes | Edges | Communities | Connected Components | Largest Component | Density | Modularity |
|------|------:|------:|------------:|---------------------:|------------------:|--------:|-----------:|
| Phase 1 | 754 | 1,893 | 54 | 48 | 652 | 0.006668 | 0.640777 |
| Phase 2 | 1,111 | 2,455 | 125 | 107 | 883 | 0.003981 | 0.727473 |
| Phase 3 | 1,628 | 3,363 | 179 | 156 | 1,290 | 0.002539 | 0.693744 |

### Overall network summary

- **Nodes:** 2,520
- **Edges:** 6,145
- **Connected components:** 221
- **Largest connected component:** 2,024 nodes
- **Density:** 0.001936
- **Average clustering:** 0.000136
- **Communities (overall):** 253
- **Overall modularity:** 0.714908

### Interpreting these results

The main structural trend is clear:

- the conflict system **expands** strongly from Phase 1 to Phase 3,
- the number of communities increases substantially,
- density decreases over time, indicating **expansion and fragmentation** rather than convergence into one dense block,
- modularity remains high across all phases, showing a persistent **community/bloc structure**.

### Top bridge actors (overall, cleaned)

The cleaned bridge-actor list is dominated by actors with cross-theater or structurally linking roles, including:

- Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)
- Military Forces of Yemen (2017–) Houthi
- Military Forces of Israel (2022–)
- Military Forces of Syria (2000–2024)
- Military Forces of Turkey (2016–)
- Syrian Democratic Forces
- PKK
- Hadi-aligned Yemeni forces

### Top bridge actor by phase

- **Phase 1:** ISIL
- **Phase 2:** Military Forces of Yemen (2017–) Houthi
- **Phase 3:** Military Forces of Israel (2022–)

This phase shift is one of the central substantive findings of the project.

## 9. Recommended local execution order

For reproducible end-to-end execution, the recommended order is:

1. **Diagnostic notebook**
   - verify data availability and schema,
   - confirm that paths in `config.yaml` are correct.

2. **Harmonization**
   - merge ACLED and GED into a common format.

3. **Scope filtering**
   - restrict to the strict core-theater dataset.

4. **Phase segmentation**
   - create phase labels.

5. **Network construction**
   - build overall and phase-wise edge lists.

6. **Metric computation**
   - compute node-level and graph-level network statistics.

7. **Community + bridge analysis**
   - detect communities and rank bridge actors.

8. **Visualization notebooks**
   - create presentation-quality plots.

- notebook/runtime parameters.

If you move datasets or change local folder names, update the configuration accordingly.

---

## 11. Reproducibility notes

To keep the analysis reproducible:

- use the same raw ACLED and GED files throughout one run,
- keep a consistent `data/` structure,
- do not mix old harmonized outputs with new ACLED exports,
